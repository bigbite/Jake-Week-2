# Mental-Health-Awareness
creating a mental health awareness site in order to practice key git commands and utilise github.

**What is the project :**

Aims to create a seamless website for a Mental Health Awareness company contaning information and ways to contact them directly.

- Ways this was achieved :
  + Created a Homepage contaning lots of quick easy information, for example the list of headers and complimentary paragraphs with hover functionality to capture the users attention. The Modals on the 
    homepage allow the user to delve deeper into the information without the page becoming cluttered or overwhelming.

  + Created a Resources page allowing users to learn more about mental health itself, this was achieved using images and paragraphs within a container that links to external websites with expertise on the 
    subject. The Resources page also contained 3 dropdown boxes, one for each mental health organisation, upon click it dropdowns the contact information. This prevented the page from becoming overwhelming 
    with the amount of information given to the user.

  + Created a contact page allowing users to easily get in touch with the organisation. This page was static (meaning the user cannot scroll up or down) this allows for all contact information to be quickly 
    an easily accessed by the user as there is no navigation needed. The page is split into 2, a form on the right and a contact info section on the left. The form contains validation preventing the user 
    from inputting invalid information. The contact info section includes links to the organisations social media but also the address, email, phone number etc.

- Why is this website useful:
  + Its very good at giving the user lots of information but using techniques to make this as least overwhelming as possible.
  + It contains lots of user interactivity making navigating the page more enjoyable and interesting.
  + It contains Accessibility friendly features such as labels for users who need text to speech.
  + Its very good at giving the user enough information to find what they are are looking for without a huge faq's section.
